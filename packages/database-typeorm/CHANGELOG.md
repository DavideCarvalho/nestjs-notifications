## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 0048cb5: Ecosystem-wide improvements across reliability, delivery, localization, and packaging.

  ## ⚠️ Breaking-ish: `ChannelContext` payload signature

  Channel payload methods now receive a `ChannelContext` argument. Methods such as
  `toMail(notifiable)` become `toMail(notifiable, ctx)` / `toMail(ctx)` — the channel
  payload method signature has changed. This is the one source-level change consumers
  must adapt to. Because the ecosystem is still pre-1.0 (alpha), this is shipped as a
  **minor** bump rather than a major. Update any custom channel payload methods
  (`toMail`, `toSms`, `toPush`, `toSlack`, `toDiscord`, `toTelegram`, `toTeams`,
  `toWebhook`, `toBroadcast`, etc.) to accept the new `ChannelContext`.

  ## Reliability & delivery
  - **Dedup / idempotency keys** — duplicate dispatches are collapsed via configurable idempotency keys.
  - **Throttle / rate-limiting** — per-channel/per-recipient throttling to protect downstream providers.
  - **Durable Redis dispatcher** — sorted-set backed queue with a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for failed jobs.
  - **Configurable BullMQ retry/backoff/DLQ** — tunable retry counts, backoff strategy, and DLQ routing.
  - **Push batch send + dead-token pruning** — batched push delivery with automatic pruning of dead/expired tokens.
  - **Generalized provider failover** — failover across providers for SMS, webhook, and Slack channels.
  - **Cross-channel fallback chains** — fall back to alternate channels when a primary channel fails.

  ## Scheduling & preferences
  - **Quiet hours + timezone** — suppress/defer delivery during recipient quiet hours, timezone-aware.
  - **REAL digest collection + flush** — actual pending-digest collection and scheduled flush, backed by
    pending-digest stores (in-memory / TypeORM / MikroORM / Prisma).

  ## Localization & sync
  - **i18n / localization** — `LocaleResolver` + `Translator` for localized notification content.
  - **Cross-device read-sync** — read state synchronized across a recipient's devices.

  ## Data layer
  - **DB-level pagination pushdown** — pagination is pushed down to the database instead of in-memory slicing.
  - **Cross-store contract tests** — shared contract test suites run against every store implementation, plus
    Postgres/MySQL testcontainers integration coverage.

  ## Packaging
  - **Dual ESM/CJS packaging** — all packages now ship both ESM and CJS builds (tsup), with a LICENSE per package.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 851170c: Persist the captured trigger context. Adds NULLABLE `causerType`/`causerId`/`traceId` columns to `NotificationEntity` and maps them in the store. These self-heal on existing tables via `ensureNotificationsTable`'s non-destructive column-add (they are nullable, so they are added — not skipped — even on a populated table), and old rows read back as null.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 64bee81: Non-destructive column-ensure: `ensureNotificationsTable` now adds columns missing from an existing table (not just creating absent tables), via `TableUtils.createTableColumnOptions`. A NOT-NULL-no-default column on a populated table is skipped with a clear warning instead of throwing.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 39b9152: Implement the optional `NotificationStore.prune()` (scheduled pruning) and `upsert()` (updatable/progress notifications) for the typeorm store.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 88aa12f: Multi-tenancy + use NestJS's own `@Inject` for service injection.

  **Multi-tenancy** (the same user can live in many workspaces — each with an isolated feed):

  - `notifications.forTenant(id)` / `forTenants([...])` scope a send to one or many tenants; a
    `@Tenant()` property on the notification (or notifiable) infers it, and may be a `string` or
    `string[]` (the send fans out to each tenant, one delivery + storage row per tenant).
  - The database channel stores a `tenantId` (column auto-created); the read API scopes by it:
    `notificationsQuery.forTenant(id).unread(user)`. TypeORM / MikroORM / Prisma adapters all carry
    `tenantId` and filter by it (undefined = all tenants). `SendResult` carries the `tenant`.
  - The tenant is threaded through the sync, event-emitter, BullMQ and Redis dispatchers, and is
    available to channels via the new `DeliveryContext` (3rd arg of `ChannelDriver.send`).

  **BREAKING (0.x): `@InjectService` removed.** Use NestJS's own `@Inject(TOKEN)` on a notification
  property — the library populates it from the container at delivery time by reading Nest's
  `PROPERTY_DEPS_METADATA`. One documented primitive instead of a custom decorator.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- bc24fcd: Self-contained schema: the database channel creates its table on its own.

  - `DatabaseChannelModule.forRoot/forFeature({ autoCreateSchema })` — defaults to **true**. On
    bootstrap the store's `ensureSchema()` creates the `notifications` table (and any missing
    columns) **non-destructively** (never drops). Set `false` to manage the schema via migrations.
  - `NotificationStore.ensureSchema?()` is now part of the interface; the TypeORM and MikroORM
    stores implement it using their own schema diff (so it's driver-portable). Prisma defers to
    `prisma migrate` (no-op + log).
  - Migration helpers for the migrations-controlled path:
    - TypeORM: `createNotificationsTable(queryRunner)` / `ensureNotificationsTable(dataSource)`.
    - MikroORM: `notificationsSchemaSql(em)` (for `this.addSql(...)`) / `ensureNotificationsTable(em)`.

  Real-SQLite integration tests cover create-on-demand and idempotency for both adapters.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 4b3bd0a: Database channel: add an in-app read API and harden the ORM adapters.

  - New `NotificationsQueryService` (in `@dudousxd/nestjs-notifications-database`) for showing
    stored notifications in-app: `all`, `unread`, `unreadCount`, `paginate`, `markAsRead`,
    `markAllAsRead`, `delete` — accepts a `Notifiable` or a `{ type, id }` ref. Plus an optional
    `createNotificationsController({ resolveRef })` factory that mounts the matching REST routes.
  - TypeORM adapter: portable column types (works on SQLite/MySQL/Postgres) and code-set
    millisecond timestamps for stable ordering — fixes `timestamp`/`json`/`uuid` types that broke
    on SQLite.
  - MikroORM adapter: explicit `datetime` columns so `readAt`/`createdAt`/`updatedAt` round-trip as
    `Date` on every driver.

  Both ORM adapters now have real-database (SQLite) integration tests.
