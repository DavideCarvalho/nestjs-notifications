# @dudousxd/nestjs-notifications-core

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 67db54f: Add ad-hoc channel filtering to sends — `notifications.only([...])` / `notifications.except([...])`, composable with `forTenant`. Enrich the `notification.sent` / `notification.failed` events with the tenant, delivery duration (ms), and the channel's response.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 09170d8: Per-tenant channel config, rich email, and an app-wide preference gate.

  - **Per-tenant config**: mail/sms/push take `resolveTransport(tenant)` and slack/webhook take
    `resolveOptions(tenant)` — a send scoped with `forTenant(id)` uses that tenant's credentials,
    falling back to the default when none.
  - **Rich email**: `MarkdownMailRenderer` + `MailMessage.markdown()` render Markdown to HTML (via
    the optional `marked` peer).
  - **Preference gate**: core gained an optional `PreferenceGate` (token
    `NOTIFICATION_PREFERENCE_GATE`) consulted before every channel delivery — muted channels are
    reported as `skipped`. See the new `@dudousxd/nestjs-notifications-preferences` package.

- 88aa12f: Multi-tenancy + use NestJS's own `@Inject` for service injection.

  **Multi-tenancy** (the same user can live in many workspaces — each with an isolated feed):

  - `notifications.forTenant(id)` / `forTenants([...])` scope a send to one or many tenants; a
    `@Tenant()` property on the notification (or notifiable) infers it, and may be a `string` or
    `string[]` (the send fans out to each tenant, one delivery + storage row per tenant).
  - The database channel stores a `tenantId` (column auto-created); the read API scopes by it:
    `notificationsQuery.forTenant(id).unread(user)`. TypeORM / MikroORM / Prisma adapters all carry
    `tenantId` and filter by it (undefined = all tenants). `SendResult` carries the `tenant`.
  - The tenant is threaded through the sync, event-emitter, BullMQ and Redis dispatchers, and is
    available to channels via the new `DeliveryContext` (3rd arg of `ChannelDriver.send`).

  **BREAKING (0.x): `@InjectService` removed.** Use NestJS's own `@Inject(TOKEN)` on a notification
  property — the library populates it from the container at delivery time by reading Nest's
  `PROPERTY_DEPS_METADATA`. One documented primitive instead of a custom decorator.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 9361399: Core DX overhaul (all additive):

  - **`send()` returns a `SendResult[]`** — per-notifiable, per-channel outcome
    (`sent`/`failed`/`skipped`/`queued`) with the transport `response` or `error`.
  - **`shouldSend(notifiable, channel)`** — Laravel-style per-channel gate (skipped channels are
    reported, not delivered).
  - **`afterSending(notifiable, channel, response)`** — lifecycle hook called after each delivery
    with the channel's transport response.
  - **`delay`** (ms or `Date`) — scheduled delivery, honored by the BullMQ (native), Redis and
    in-process event-emitter dispatchers.
  - **Decorator-driven notifiables** — declare addresses with `@RouteFor('mail')` and the async
    reference with `@Notifiable()` + `@NotifiableId()`, dropping the `routeNotificationFor` switch
    and manual `toNotifiableRef()` (the method form still works and overrides the decorators).

  Channels now resolve addresses via `routeFor` and return their transport response so it flows
  into `afterSending`/`SendResult`.
