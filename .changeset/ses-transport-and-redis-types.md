mail: add `SesTransport` — an AWS SES v2 `MailTransport` that builds a full MIME message (so attachments work, unlike SES "Simple" content) via nodemailer's MailComposer and sends it as `Content.Raw`. `@aws-sdk/client-sesv2` is an optional peer (imported lazily). Also exports `composeRawEmail`.

sse: loosen `RedisPubSubClient.subscribe` to a single-channel signature (drop the optional callback) so a raw `ioredis` instance is assignable with no `as unknown as` cast — its variadic `subscribe` overload requires a trailing callback that the previous signature couldn't match.
